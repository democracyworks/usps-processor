# usps-processor

## Setup

You'll need a config.edn file available as a resource. See
`dev-resources/config.edn.sample` for guidance.

The valid values for `:aws :sqs :region` are the enum values listed in
the API documentation for [com.amazonaws.regions.Regions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/regions/Regions.html)

## Running it

### In docker

Create a `docker-dev-resources/config.edn` file based on the sample
file there. The `datomic` value is appropriate for running inside
Docker.

1. Set up [immutant-docker](https://github.com/turbovote/immutant-docker)
as specified in its README.
2. `./script/docker-run`

### Standalone

To run the Importer:

```sh
lein run -m usps-processor.importer
```

To run the API:

```sh
lein run -m usps-processor.api
```

### Immutant

To run both in Immutant:

```sh
lein immutant deploy
lein immutant run
```

## Updating resources/zipcode-city-state.edn

To update resources/zipcode-city-state.edn, in the case that the USPS releases new data, download the new data from
http://www.usps.com/mailtracking/_csv/NonAutomated5Digit.csv and transform it into an edn map from integer zipcodes
to maps of the city and state. Note that some zipcodes appear multiple times. The existing file has made the decision
to take the first instance of a zipcode and remove all later ones.
